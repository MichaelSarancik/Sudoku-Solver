# Sudoku-Solver
This is my brute force approach to a sudoku solver that reads random puzzles to solve from a csv file. If you want to test the algorithm please download the file from the google drive link in the txt file and make sure the file is in the same folder as the python file. (This was ran and tested on pycharm)
